      <h2 class="line">Dedicated Advocacy for the Injured in Southern California</h2>
      <p>Gordon Levinson is a former insurance defense / personal injury litigator who represented some of the largest insurance companies in North America. Prior to founding the Levinson Law Group, he served as an associate in numerous law firms from 1996 to 2003 before working as a partner in a personal injury firm from 2004 to 2007. Managing his own law firm has enabled him to represent clients and serve his community with his signature approach: Diligent community involvement, integrity in advocacy, and supportive, results-driven representation.</p>
      <p class="custom">
        <The>Levinson Law Group focuses on cases involving auto accidents in Southern California. The attorneys at the firm, led by Mr. Levinson, exhibit excellence and commitment to each and every client, fighting passionately for the rights of injury victims and bereaved families in Southern California in personal injury and wrongful death cases. Gordon is proud to be a long-time leader in the community, giving back to local charitable organizations through the Levinson Foundation and serving as an actively involved advisory board member for Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).</The>
      </p>
      <h2>Aggressive & Effective Trial Attorney Serving Carlsbad, CA</h2>
      <p>Over the course of his career to date, Gordon has had success in representing over 3,000 unique clients, and has either appeared or submitted briefs in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 30 county superior courts</li>
        <li>3 federal district trial courts</li>
        <li>3 state courts of appeal</li>
        <li>The state Supreme Court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An experienced and high-achieving trial lawyer, Gordon has brought the Levinson Law Group to the forefront of personal injury law in the region. The firm is a 5-star practice with overwhelmingly positive Yelp and Avvo reviews and a steady stream of referrals from previous clients, doctors, other attorneys, and even judges and court staff members who recognize the Levinson Law Group as an effective and outstanding advocate for the injured.</p>
      <h2>20 Years of Experience on Your Side</h2>
      <p>Gordon graduated from the University of San Francisco School of Law with his Juris Doctorate degree in 1996. During his time in law school, he was a member of the Law Review. He was also a decorated Moot Court competitor, representing his school in a national competition where he received the highest score of any individual competitor—a perfect 100.</p>
      <p>Before founding the Levinson Law Group, Gordon’s prior experience as an insurance industry insider significantly benefits his clients, as he is able to bring a unique perspective and understanding to these cases, implementing customized case management systems to maximize their recovery and to ensure they receive the compensation to which they are entitled. When he is not in the office, Gordon enjoys spending time with his wife and children. A musician and avid surfer, he spends much of his free time traveling and coaching youth basketball.</p>

      <dl class="accordion">
        <dt><a href="">If i retain your law firm, how much will it cost me?</a></dt>
        <dd>We accept cases on a contingent fee basis. That means if we don’t win your case, you pay us nothing. If we do win your case, our fee is a percentage of the money we win for you. The amount of the percentage depends on the circumstances of each case and will be in writing as part of our initial fee agreement.</dd>
        <dt><a href="">Who decides how much we should accept in settlement?</a></dt>
        <dd>You decide whether to accept a settlement offer. As the client, you have the right to accept or decline all settlement offers, or to continue negotiating. Your attorneys do not have the right to accept a settlement offer without your consent.</dd>
        <dt><a href="">How long will my case take?</a></dt>
        <dd>That depends on several factors. Typically, we do not attempt to settle a case until the client is done receiving treatment from doctors. Your bills will not be finalized until you are done with treatment, so the total amount of your damages cannot be calculated until that time. If everything works perfectly, your records and bills will arrive at our office shortly after you are done receiving treatment for your injuries, and we will be able to make a fully documented settlement demand at that time, and your case should be settled within 30 days of the demand being made. However, life is rarely perfect, and several factors might cause delay in your case. Sometimes, it takes longer than expected to collect all the medical bills and records needed to prove your damages. Although we promptly request all bills and records to be sent to our office from your doctors, sometimes medical offices take longer than we would like to send complete copies of the patient’s file. Other factors that could cause delay include the government (if you have Medicare or Medi-Cal), the military recovery process (if you or your spouse are in the military), Kaiser Permanente (if that is your HMO) or other institutions that classically move slowly. Finally, you might have permanent injuries or require future medical treatment, which might cause us to move more slowly and thoughtfully than if you had minor injuries that are obviously healed.</dd>
        <dt><a href="">Will my case go to trial?</a></dt>
        <dd>
          The short answer is “probably not.” Most cases we accept have fairly clear liability, and therefore settle without much controversy. However, occasionally we must file a lawsuit if the other party is unreasonable. When that happens, we litigate the case and prepare for trial. Of those cases that find themselves in litigation, about 95% settle before the trial date. So the odds are that your particular case will probably not go to trial. On the other hand, if your case cannot be settled and must be tried, we have plenty of trial experience and a winning trial record.
