        a(href='') If i retain your law firm, how much will it cost me?
      dd.
        We accept cases on a contingent fee basis. That means if we don’t win your case, you pay us nothing. If we do win your case, our fee is a percentage of the money we win for you. The amount of the percentage depends on the circumstances of each case and will be in writing as part of our initial fee agreement.
      dt
        a(href='') Who decides how much we should accept in settlement?
      dd.
        You decide whether to accept a settlement offer. As the client, you have the right to accept or decline all settlement offers, or to continue negotiating. Your attorneys do not have the right to accept a settlement offer without your consent.
      dt
        a(href='') How long will my case take?
      dd.
        That depends on several factors. Typically, we do not attempt to settle a case until the client is done receiving treatment from doctors. Your bills will not be finalized until you are done with treatment, so the total amount of your damages cannot be calculated until that time. If everything works perfectly, your records and bills will arrive at our office shortly after you are done receiving treatment for your injuries, and we will be able to make a fully documented settlement demand at that time, and your case should be settled within 30 days of the demand being made. However, life is rarely perfect, and several factors might cause delay in your case. Sometimes, it takes longer than expected to collect all the medical bills and records needed to prove your damages. Although we promptly request all bills and records to be sent to our office from your doctors, sometimes medical offices take longer than we would like to send complete copies of the patient’s file. Other factors that could cause delay include the government (if you have Medicare or Medi-Cal), the military recovery process (if you or your spouse are in the military), Kaiser Permanente (if that is your HMO) or other institutions that classically move slowly. Finally, you might have permanent injuries or require future medical treatment, which might cause us to move more slowly and thoughtfully than if you had minor injuries that are obviously healed.

        a(href='') Will my case go to trial?
      dd.
        The short answer is “probably not.” Most cases we accept have fairly clear liability, and therefore settle without much controversy. However, occasionally we must file a lawsuit if the other party is unreasonable. When that happens, we litigate the case and prepare for trial. Of those cases that find themselves in litigation, about 95% settle before the trial date. So the odds are that your particular case will probably not go to trial. On the other hand, if your case cannot be settled and must be tried, we have plenty of trial experience and a winning trial record.
